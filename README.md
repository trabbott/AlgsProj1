# AlgsProj1
## Compilation
To compile the code simply run the make command in the root directory. This will compile all of the source files into an executable named **dijkstra**.

## Dependencies
No dependencies other than the standard C/C++ libraries are required.

## Usage
By default, the program will prompt the user for command line input. If you want to input a file, use the **-f** or **--file** flags followed by the path to the input file. To see the help message use the **-h** or **--help** flags.<br>

## Output
The program will output all of the possible optional paths from the source to the destination along with their lengths as well as the shortest path using only existing roads along with its length. Further, it will explicitly state which, if any, of the optional paths produces a shorter route from source to destination than the shortest path using only existing roads.
