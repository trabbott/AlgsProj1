Calculating Shortest Path...

Shortest path using existing roads:
0 -> 1 -> 3 with length 30


============ PATHS MADE BY OPTIONAL ROADS BELOW =====================

Paths using an optional road:
  Path 1: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 with length 25


==================== SHORTEST PATH SUMMARY BELOW ==============================

1: Optional path 1 is shorter than the path using only existing roads.

Optional path 1 is the shortest possible path and has length 25.
