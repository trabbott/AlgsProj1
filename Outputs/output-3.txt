Calculating Shortest Path...

Shortest path using existing roads:

There is no path from 0 to 5 using only existing roads.


============ PATHS MADE BY OPTIONAL ROADS BELOW =====================

Paths using an optional road:
  Path 1: 0 -> 1 -> 4 -> 5 with length 5
  Path 2: 0 -> 2 -> 3 -> 5 with length 6


==================== SHORTEST PATH SUMMARY BELOW ==============================

2+: Optional paths 1 and 2 are shorter than the path using only existing roads.

Optional path 1 is the shortest possible path and has length 5.
